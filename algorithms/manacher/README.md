# 2.8 Longest palindrome using Manacher approach

## Definition

A word _w_ is a palindrome if the first character of _w_ is equal to the last one, the second one is equal to the before last, etc.
We want to find the longest substring of a string _s_ that is a palindrome.

**complexity**: _O_(_n_)

**input**: a string (e.g. `nonne`)
**ouptut**: its longest palindrome (e.g. `non`)

## usage

```sh
$ python manacher.py < data.in
```
