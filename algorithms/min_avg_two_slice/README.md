# MinAvgTwoSlice

## Definition

A sequence A of N integers can be divided in slices of minimum of two elements.
The goal is to find the starting point of the slice having the lowest average
value in the entire sequence.

**complexity**: _O_(_n_)

**input**: Two or more integers separated by spaces (e.g. `36 48 60`)  
**ouptut**: index if the begining of the lowest average slice in the sequence

## usage

```sh
$ python min_avg_two_slice.py < data.in
```
